# ciscoProject
This project is a try to automate all the configuration of switches and routers with the best practices learned by me.

# Routers and switches
I will use GNS3 to configure all cisco routers with a image that will be on this repo

# Vmware
You need a virtualization tool to use gns3 with his server. The server will help you to simulate the network

# Visual enviroment
I think that a good option is use a visual interface like tkinter or PyQt5 to see the grid in action. This is the last part of my project

# Construction
I will break the code in little parts to make this easier and make the config that allows us to have a better readbility
